# 3D_Virtual_Multiverse
This project involves developing an ecommerce platform dedicated to selling Metaverse gadgets and providing information about Metaverse games. The frontend of the website, where users interact with the platform, is built using HTML for creating web pages, CSS for styling and layout design, and JavaScript for adding interactivity and dynamic features. The backend, which handles data storage, processing, and business logic, is powered by MySQL, a relational database management system, and runs on an Apache server, a widely-used web server software. This integration of technologies creates a seamless and functional ecommerce experience focused on Metaverse-related products and content.
